<h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>The Mission</h3>
    <p>
        The aim of this project is to produce a module for ArgoUML that can
        generate pdf reports of data contained in an ArgoUML project.
        
        The module will use a free Java library <a href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/">iText</a>.

        The reason for doing this is that it will make much easier to maintain the documentation of any data, contained in ArgoUML.
        The user just need to select what he wants to see in the report and the report will be generated on the fly.
