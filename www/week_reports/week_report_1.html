	<li>Start to read ArgoUML cookbook and review code.</li>
	<li>I have read docs of ArgoPrint</li>
	<li><div>My first problem was, when i tried to compile the source code of ArgoUML, i had errors in 4 files.
               <br>I tried to find the problem, and found <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=commits&msgNo=1447">this</a>.
               <br>All what mvw did, was not working, because ToolBarFactory do not have public constructor. I was watching toolbar v1.3 
               and toolbar v1.4beta.</div></li>
	<li><div>Next problem, When i returned the changes of mvw of this 4 files to compile ArgoUML, i tried to run it. 
		   And I had an exception: java.lang.AbstractMethodError. This is my <a href="logs/AbstractMethodError_w1.txt">logs</a>.</div></li>
	<li><div>Next point of what i almost did, is the first view of the architecture of ArgoPDF.

               I planed to end it today, but by the reason of my troubles with compiling and running ArgoUML i didn't do it.</div></li>
