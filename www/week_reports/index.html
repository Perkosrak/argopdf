<h2>Week Reports</h2>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #5</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and developed the ArgoPDF dialog.</li>
        <li>Described in the documentation ArgoPDF dialog. You can find it <a href="../nonav/docs/user_interface.html">here</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to write ArgoPDF documentation.</li>
            <li>Start to work on the report: design and develop title page and some other parts of the report. 
            Write the basic prototype to understand how to extract information from the ArgoUML and to use it in the report.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #3, #4</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Continued to write ArgoPDF documentation.</li>
        <li>Ended to read ArgoUML cookbook.</li>
        <li>Reviewed code of ArgoUML and understood the main concepts of creating modules for ArgoUML.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <h4>The problems which i had had during these two weeks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The main problem is that i did't have enough time because of my university examinations.</li>
            <li>Next problem is that i can't exactly define the structure of the report. I am sure this problem 
                will be solved during discussion with developers of ArgoUML.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to write ArgoPDF documentation.</li>
            <li>Design, develop and describe in the documentation ArgoPDF dialog, which will be displayed when ArgoPDF
                starts from the ArgoUML.</li>
        </ul>

	<h3>Week Report #2</h3>

      <ul>

            <li>Almost finish to read ArgoUML cookbook.</li>
            <li>Started to write documentation of the project. You can find it <a href="../nonav/docs/index.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Tryed to describe main components of the future reports i.e. what data from ArgoUML it will include.
                Draft variant can be found <a href="../nonav/docs/report.html">here</a>.</li>

                  <li>Continue to write ArgoPDF documentation.</li>
                  <li>Continue to explore ArgoUML and find out what information can be used for the reports.</li>

	<h3>Week Report #1</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Applied for an Observer role in the argouml project</li>
		<li><div>Linus and Ion created a separate project for ArgoPDF: argopdf.tigris.com
	        <br>Applied for Observer and Developer roles in this project
      	    <br>Subscribed to the dev, commits, issues and users lists of argoPDF</div></li>
		<li>I have read Manual of Subversion</li>
		<li>I made work copy of ArgoUML and ArgoPrint</li>
		<li>Start to read ArgoUML cookbook and review code.</li>
		<li>I have read docs of ArgoPrint</li>
		<li><div>My first problem was, when i tried to compile the source code of ArgoUML, i had errors in 4 files.
      	         <br>I tried to find the problem, and found <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=commits&msgNo=1447">this</a>.
            	 <br>All what mvw did, was not working, because ToolBarFactory do not have public constructor. I was watching toolbar v1.3 
	                 and toolbar v1.4beta.</div></li>
		<li><div>Next problem, When i returned the changes of mvw of this 4 files to compile ArgoUML, i tried to run it. 
			     And I had an exception: java.lang.AbstractMethodError. This is my <a href="logs/AbstractMethodError_w1.txt">logs</a>.
			</div></li>
		<li><div>Next point of what i almost did, is the first view of the architecture of ArgoPDF.
			     I want to describe the main conceptions and how ArgoPDF will work.
            	 I planed to end it today, but by the reason of my troubles with compiling and running ArgoUML i didn't do it.
            </div></li>
	</ul>

      <p>
		<h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>To find out, why changes, made by mvw, is not working (what solution is correct)</li>
			<li>What is the reason of my failure in compiling and running ArgoUML</li>
			<li>Finish to describe my first view of the architecture of ArgoPDF</li>
			<li>Continue reading ArgoUML cookbook and review code to find out what will be useful for ArgoPDF</li>
